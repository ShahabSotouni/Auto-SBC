# Project Brief: EAFC Ultimate Team Automation Tool

## Project Definition

This automation tool is designed to streamline the process of solving Squad Building Challenges (SBCs) in EA Sports FC (formerly FIFA) Ultimate Team. It combines a frontend component with a backend solver to provide optimal SBC solutions using players from the user's club with minimal cost.

## Core Requirements

1. **Automated SBC Solutions**
   - Parse SBC requirements from the web app
   - Collect player data from the user's club
   - Determine optimal player combinations to satisfy requirements
   - Present and apply solutions directly in the web app

2. **Cost Optimization**
   - Prioritize untradeable and duplicate players
   - Consider player market values when determining solutions
   - Allow manual player exclusions and preferences

3. **User Interface**
   - Seamless integration with the EAFC web app
   - Clear solution presentation
   - Configuration options for optimization preferences
   - Visual indicators for player pricing and status

4. **Performance**
   - Efficient solutions generation within a user-defined time limit
   - Caching of frequently used data
   - Minimal performance impact on the web app

## Project Goals

1. **Primary Goal**
   - Save users time and coins when completing SBCs by automating the tedious process of finding optimal player combinations

2. **Secondary Goals**
   - Provide insights into club inventory through data visualization
   - Help users make more informed decisions about which SBCs to complete
   - Allow for automated batch processing of multiple SBCs

## Success Criteria

1. Successfully solves all types of SBCs with valid solutions
2. Consistently provides solutions using fewer resources (coins) than manual completion
3. Seamlessly integrates with the EAFC web app without disrupting normal functionality
4. Maintains user privacy and security while operating within the terms of service
5. Provides a user-friendly experience with appropriate customization options
