# Product Context: EAFC Ultimate Team Automation Tool

## Problem Statement

Squad Building Challenges (SBCs) in EA Sports FC Ultimate Team represent a significant time investment for players:

1. **Complexity**: SBCs require building squads that meet specific requirements (rating, chemistry, nationality, league, etc.)
2. **Resource-Intensive**: Using high-rated players inefficiently can result in substantial coin loss
3. **Time-Consuming**: Manually finding optimal combinations from hundreds of players is tedious and error-prone
4. **Opportunity Cost**: Inefficient SBC completion reduces resources available for other game activities

## User Pain Points

1. **Optimization Difficulty**: Determining which players to use while minimizing cost is mathematically complex
2. **Duplicate Management**: Deciding when to use duplicate players efficiently
3. **Price Awareness**: Maintaining awareness of current market values for hundreds of players
4. **Decision Fatigue**: Evaluating whether an SBC is worth completing based on cost/reward analysis
5. **Repetitive Tasks**: Repeatedly solving similar SBCs with slightly different requirements

## Solution

Our automation tool addresses these challenges through:

1. **Automated Optimization**: Using constraint programming to find mathematically optimal solutions
2. **Smart Player Selection**: Prioritizing untradeable and duplicate players to minimize coin expenditure
3. **Market Integration**: Incorporating current player prices from external APIs
4. **User Control**: Allowing users to lock/exclude specific players from solutions
5. **Time Efficiency**: Reducing the time to complete SBCs from minutes to seconds

## User Experience Goals

1. **Seamlessness**: Integrate naturally with the EAFC web app without disrupting normal workflows
2. **Transparency**: Clearly show why players were selected and what the cost is
3. **Control**: Provide options to customize optimization parameters
4. **Trust**: Consistently produce valid solutions that are better than manual attempts
5. **Privacy**: Operate locally without sending sensitive account data to external servers

## Target Users

1. **Regular SBC Completers**: Players who routinely complete SBCs to improve their Ultimate Team
2. **Club Optimizers**: Players focused on maximizing the value of their club inventory
3. **Time-Constrained Players**: Users with limited time who want to efficiently complete SBCs
4. **Trading/Investment-Oriented Players**: Users who complete SBCs as part of broader coin-making strategies

## Value Proposition

Our automation tool transforms the SBC experience from a time-consuming puzzle to an efficient, automated process that:

1. **Saves Time**: Reduces the time needed to complete SBCs by 80-90%
2. **Preserves Resources**: Minimizes coin expenditure by optimally selecting players
3. **Enhances Decision-Making**: Provides data to help users decide which SBCs are worth completing
4. **Reduces Friction**: Streamlines the entire SBC workflow from squad building to submission
5. **Improves Outcomes**: Consistently produces better solutions than manual attempts
